# Design Refresh Plan

- Hero → Studio Freight pacing + Active Theory blob; with-Denerf story → Locomotive scroll-sync cards; blob/lighter → Bakken & Bæck soft 3D pastels; toolbelt → orbit carousel like Stink; trust → Koto color blocks + jitter logos; contact → Obys magnetic CTA + card flow.
- Tokens (`index.css`) → add dark anchor `#0B2A1B`, neon mint `#7CFFB2`, off-white `#F9F7F3`; set display/sans pairing; motion guardrails (`prefers-reduced-motion`), shadow/glow utilities.
- Hero (mobile-first) → rotating verb headline, interactive blob or Spline fallback, magnetic primary CTA, secondary “scope it” CTA, sticky bottom quick-bar (call/DM/Book).
- Case/gallery → horizontal snap cards with 2–3 looping MP4/WebM (under 3MB), tactile depth/tilt, tag chips; toolbelt orbit carousel with pause-on-touch and auto-rotate.
- Contact → card-based “choose your adventure” (homepage revamp/motion system/product UI), quick actions (WhatsApp/Telegram/email), calendar link, response-time badge, playful microcopy.
